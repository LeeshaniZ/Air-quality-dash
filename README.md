# Air-quality-dash

Users interact with the Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard project because it provides 
current air quality information together with historic Colombo Metropolitan Area measurement 
data through a web application platform. The system presents data acquired from artificial air 
quality sensors which are positioned throughout the city. The present dashboard shows live air 
quality index (AQI) readings while displaying historical performance graphs that enable both 
public health organizations and scientists and citizens to obtain data for air quality programs and 
public health decisions.
